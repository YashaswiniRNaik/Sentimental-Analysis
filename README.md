# Sentimental-Analysis

o Situation: performing real-time sentimental analysis on real-time data collecting from twitter.

o Task: Develop an automated system to analyze customer sentiments. Data fetching directly from twitter.

o Action: Collected data, created an NLP-based sentiment analysis system to classify and analyze reviews.

o Result: The model scores at 75% of accuracy, emphasizes the necessity of iterative improvement.


Improvements for Future

More Elaborate Preprocessing: Adding lemmatization, removing stop words, and how to deal with emojis are other methods of better text preprocessing, thus representing better features.

Improved Models: Utilizing high-end NLP models such as BERT or GPT-based transformers can drastically enhance the performance of sentiment classification, especially the poor negative class.

Hyperparameters Tuning: Tuning hyperparameters and performing cross-validation to optimize the model could also improve model performance.

Balance the Dataset: By oversampling the minority class or collecting additional data, better class balance and higher accuracy may be achieved in the predictions.

This project emphasizes the necessity of iterative improvement and the inclusion of advanced techniques to achieve reliable results in sentiment analysis.
